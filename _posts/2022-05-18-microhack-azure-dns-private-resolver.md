With [Alexis Plantin](https://alexisplantin.fr/), we just released a [MicroHack](https://github.com/dawlysd/azure-dns-private-resolver-microhack) around [Azure DNS Private Resolver](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-private-resolver-overview) (public preview).

The MicroHack is available on GitHub: [https://github.com/dawlysd/azure-dns-private-resolver-microhack](https://github.com/dawlysd/azure-dns-private-resolver-microhack). We share several possible architectures around this new service and you can deploy them very quickly to practice.

Before playing with the MicroHack, I recommend to read the blog post from Alexis to better understand all main Azure DNS components: [https://alexisplantin.fr/dns-private-resolver/](https://alexisplantin.fr/dns-private-resolver/).

Have fun!
